<—Rapid Fire Mode—>

Rapid mode is announced by a voice saying “Rapid Fire mode enabled”.
This means you can switch to the SPACEBAR to shoot faster bullets.
Rapid mode lasts either 1.5 or 3 seconds depending on the level you are on.
Rapid mode runs out whether you use it or not so switch as soon as the announcement ends and the siren sounds.

Your score will be displayed after you die or win the game.


<——Screen Resolution——>

In order for this game to work properly and look good, I recommend the screen resolution to be a minimum of 1024px x 768px.
